# FCCPS
Python project thingay. More precisely, a "virus" that is module based. It is made from python and perhaps throughout development other languages may be added. The point is you start with a single master file and choose what you want to enable. This will hopefully include a "min" version for the light hearted and a heavier build for those who really dare. A debug mode is on par. I will keep a file of modlules that are being worked on, even basic ideas. I don't know yet I created this repository 4 minutes ago. Okay, later on as this development continues. Each module contains a descriptor at the end. Since I do not know how big this project is going to end up being. Hopefully fairly large but you can only wish. I could use this as a journal or log but I'm guessing you really don't care about me. Feel free to add modules as you please. A cental file will be kept of variable cross compatibility. I'm glad to take requests if this even gets a minimum of attention. Also, this project very much so needs a name so please, feel free to contribute. Come on, don't be shy... come on... This is starting with each module ina separate file but this will change. As releases will be released, they will be added to "full" file (counter part being the "min" file) Don't worry, lots of work shall be done. Maybe a year long project.
